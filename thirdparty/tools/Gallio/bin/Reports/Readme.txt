Reports Plugin
==============

This plugin provides multiple report formats for generating Gallio reports.
Additional report formats can be added in several ways:

1. Adding or modifying XSLT stylesheets and registering them in the
   Gallio.Reports.plugin file as additional XsltReportFormatter
   components similar to the existing ones.
   
2. Adding new implementations of IReportFormatter to the assembly
   and registering them in the Gallio.Reports.plugin file
   in similar fashion to the XmlReportFormatter.
   
3. Creating a new Gallio plugin and registering components that implement
   the IReportFormatter interface just like XmlReportFormatter.
